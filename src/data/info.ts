  about: `I am a 17 year old web developer from Poland who is developing intensively. My passion is creating websites using various technologies. I have several major projects to my credit, such as a new school website for my technical school. I have been continuously developing in the industry for 3 years. I gained knowledge in creating websites with React.js, Vue.js, Nuxt.js, Next.js, Firebase, Strapi, Astro. In my work, I also use Tailwind CSS, which I like, and many bigger or smaller libraries, such as Apollo Graphql, FramerMotion, React Helmet. I always try to choose the right technology for the demand. I encourage you to check out my projects below. You can reach me via email or my socials.
